# Detect wrapping if-else with exit when preceded by statements

Detect the pattern where a function has statements before a wrapping if-else where one branch is a simple exit.

**Bad:**

```javascript
function process(data) {
  const cleaned = sanitize(data)
  if (cleaned.valid) {
    transform(cleaned)
    save(cleaned)
    notify()
  } else {
    return
  }
}
```

**Good:**

```javascript
function process(data) {
  const cleaned = sanitize(data)
  if (!cleaned.valid) return
  transform(cleaned)
  save(cleaned)
  notify()
}
```

The key difference from existing patterns: the if-else is the last statement but there are other statements before it. Should handle both ‘exit in if’ and ‘exit in else’ variants. Verify existing behavior first — may already be partially covered.
